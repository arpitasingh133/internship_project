      "| Subcategories[edit]  | The term \"architecture\" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson andFrederick P. Brooks, Jr., members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication about theStretch, an IBM-developedsupercomputerforLos Alamos National Laboratory(at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory). To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types, hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of \"system architecture\", a term that seemed more useful than \"machine organization\".[8] |\n",

      "| External links[edit] |       Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system. The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors. More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs, since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as thex86 Loop instruction).[17]However, longer and more complex instructions take longer for the processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively. The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions interact in unexpected ways.        |\n",
