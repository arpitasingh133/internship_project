      "|     Becoming a public figure[edit]    | Salk was immediately hailed as a \"miracle worker\" when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it in order to maximize its global distribution.[2]TheNational Foundation for Infantile Paralysisand the University of Pittsburgh looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, theirpatent attorneysaid, \"If there were any patentable novelty to be found in this phase it would lie within an extremely narrow scope and would be of doubtful value.\"[3][4]An immediate rush to vaccinate began in the United States and around the world. Many countries began polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine, including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium. By 1959, the Salk vaccine had reached about 90 countries.[5]An attenuated liveoral polio vaccinewas developed byAlbert Sabin, coming into commercial use in 1961. Less than 25 years after the release of Salk's vaccine, domestic transmission of polio had been eliminated in the United States. |\n",

Named after the founder ofCity College of New York(CCNY), it was \"a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money—and pedigree—to attend a top private school\", according to David Oshinsky, his biographer. In high school, \"he was known as a perfectionist...who read everything he could lay his hands on,\" according to one of his fellow students.[15]Students had to cram a four-year curriculum into just three years. As a result, most dropped out or flunked out, despite the school's motto \"study, study, study.\" However, of the students who graduated, most had the grades to enroll in CCNY, then noted for being a highly competitive college.[16]: 96                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there... driven by their parents.... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including moreNobel Prizewinners—eight—and PhD recipients than any other public college except theUniversity of California at Berkeley.\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"[16]: 98                                                                                                                                             |\n",

According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such asWalter Reed, who helped conqueryellow fever. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews... while most of the surrounding medical schools—Cornell,Columbia,University of Pennsylvania, andYale—had rigidquotasin place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants in 1935 out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in.[16]: 98During his years atNew York University Medical School, Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer.[17]                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

He later focused more of his studies onbacteriology, which had replaced medicine as his primary interest.

I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"[19]                                                                                                                                     |\n",
